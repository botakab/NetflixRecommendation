**Project Abstract**

The objective of this project is to analyze movie ratings provided by the Netflix Prize Competition and to **build a recommendation system**. 
The first challenge is the difficulty to handle a dataset with 100 million records, and we overcame this by working with **subsampled and filtered data**. 
We identified some interesting trends in analysis, such as customers being inclined to give higher but few ratings, 
and users that give fewer than 50 ratings tend to give higher ratings. We also performed frequent pattern mining, 
identifying movies that are frequently favored together. 
Additionally, the project involves building and testing the recommendation system itself.
